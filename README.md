## About

Shadows-of-Greg is an addon for [GregTech Nomifactory Edition](https://github.com/Nomifactory/GregTech) (formerly [GregTech Community Edition](https://github.com/GregTechCE/GregTech)), and was originally a fork of [Gregic Addons](https://github.com/TheLimePixel/GregicAdditions), updated to work with current versions of GregTechCE. This mod continues the goal of Gregic Addons by making GregTech much more complicated and realistic through the use of GregTech 5 Unofficial and GregTech 6 features.

Some features implemented specifically in this mod are:
- The Fusion Reactor
- The Processing Array
- The Assembly Line
- Additional tiers of Gregtech CE machines
- Additional materials such as Curved Plates, Double ingots, and Rounds
- The Cluster Mill, which is an machine specifically for making foils
- Forestry Integration
- Tinkers Construct Integration
- The addiiton of content from GT5U and GT6

This mod was originally created by [Shadows-of-Fire](https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire), but has had development and bug fixes taken over by the [Nomifactory Team](https://github.com/Nomifactory) for Minecraft 1.12.2. 

[Nomifactory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomifactory) is a Gregtech CE based modpack, heavily focused on automation and factory creation and features Shadows-of-Greg as one of the key endgame mods.
